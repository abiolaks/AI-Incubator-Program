if you fork a repo and the original repo get updated how will the fork repogets the lastest update

When you fork a repo on GitHub, you create a copy of the original repository (called the upstream repo). If the original (upstream) repo gets updated, your forked repo doesn't automatically receive those updates. 
You need to manually sync your fork with the upstream repository.
